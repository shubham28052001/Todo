# 🚀 Taskify — To-Do List App

**Taskify** is a simple, client-side to-do list web application. It lets you:  
- Add tasks with a priority (High / Medium / Low)  
- View all tasks, or filter by Active / Completed status  

The goal is to provide an easy, minimalistic UI to manage your daily tasks quickly.

## 📦 Demo

You can try the live version here: [Taskify Live Demo](https://shubham28052001.github.io/Todo/)

## 🛠️ How to Use / Set Up Locally

Since Taskify is a static web app (HTML + CSS + JS), you can run it easily:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Todo.git

# 2. Navigate into the folder
cd Todo

# 3. Open index.html in your browser
#    Or, optionally, start a local server for live reload:
npx http-server   # if you have http-server installed

If you like, I can **generate a full README.md file** for you *ready to copy/paste*, with sections like **License**, **Screenshots (even placeholder)**, **Badges**, and **Contribution Guidelines**.  
Do you want me to build that full version now for you?
